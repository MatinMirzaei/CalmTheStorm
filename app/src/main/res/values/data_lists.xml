        <item>Evacuate immediately if authorities tell you to do so!</item>
        <item>If trapped, then call 911 and give your location, but be aware that emergency response could be delayed or impossible. Turn on lights to help rescuers find you.</item>
        <item>Pay attention to emergency alerts and notifications for information and instructions.</item>
        <item>Use an N95 mask to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.</item>
        <item>If you are not ordered to evacuate but smoky conditions exist, stay inside in a safe location or go to a community building where smoke levels are lower.</item>
        <item> If you do not already have N95 respirators, you can reduce your exposure to smoke by doing the following:</item>
        <item>Choose a room to close off from outside air and set up a portable air cleaner or filter to keep the air in this room clean even when it’s smoky in the rest of the building and outdoors.</item>
        <item>Use high efficiency filters in your central air conditioning system to capture fine particles from smoke. If your system has fresh air intake, set the system to “recirculate” mode and close the outdoor intake damper.</item>
        <item>Avoid using anything that burns, such as candles and fireplaces. Do not vacuum, as vacuuming stirs up particles already inside your home. Do not smoke tobacco or other products. Smoking puts even more pollution into the air.</item>
        <item>Pay attention to any health symptoms if you have asthma, COPD, heart disease, or are pregnant. If you are sick and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider for further care instructions and shelter in place, if possible. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 and let the operator know if you have, or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a cloth fae covering before help arrives. If staying at a shelter or public facility, alert shelter staff immediately so they can call a local hospital or clinic.</item>

        <item>Avoid areas downwind, and river valleys downstream, of the volcano. Rubble and ash will be carried by wind and gravity.</item>
